description: '"This is the exciting story of Ree Kingdom and John Jerome, two courageous
  lads who start out from their Connecticut homes in 1790 on a perilous trip through
  the forests to live with the Indians in the Ohio River Valley, and trade with them.
  The journey is packed with unusual adventures, and not a little danger. When they
  finally reach the chosen territory, the veteran frontiersman, Tom Fish, helps them
  to find suitable location for a cabin near a Delaware village. Fishing Bird whose
  life Ree saves, becomes a staunch and loyal friend to the youthful pioneers, and
  in turn he saves the lives of young "Long Knives," as the Indian call Ree and John"--Jacket.'
